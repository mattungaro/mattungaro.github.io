Hi, I'm Matt! I'm a **Senior Data Analyst** at **[RS21](http://rs21.io)**, a software and data science company based out of New Mexico.

# Public Projects
For most of my time at RS21, I've supported data analysis and management efforts in the federal government. Consequently, most of that work is not public. However, there are a few projects that I've been involved in at the state level in New Mexico that resulted in some publicly available data and applications:

### Work with the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission
- Supported the rollout of the **[Mainstream New Mexico Water Planning Application](https://mainstreamnm.org/new-mexicos-water-data-now-an-interactive-journey/)**
- Led data cleaning, analysis, and design efforts.
- Built summary data layers to show water planners how the climate, environment, demographics, water use, etc. change between tentative water planning regions.

### Work with the New Mexico Office of Broadband Access and Expansion
- Supported the rollout of the **[New Mexico Broadband Mapping and Data Hub](https://maps.connect.nm.gov/)**. Designed and constructed version 1.
- Compiled and constructed a grant funding data set of all essential information (Providers, Projects, Funding, Fiber Miles, spatial information) from numerous data sources. Used for the **[Grants for NM Broadband](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/fa07c9e3b6e348b9b7b3279353fa810a)** application.

# University Projects
**[Prioritizing streams: The impacts of in-kind mitigation rules on an ecosystem offset market](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1462901122000491)**
- We studied a novel, in-kind stream mitigation policy in Texasâ€™s Upper Trinity River Basin. We found this policy, the Stream Mitigation Method (SMM), spawned an enduring stream mitigation market.
